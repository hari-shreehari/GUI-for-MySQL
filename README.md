“User-friendly MySQL” is created using Python’s native IDLE and is made possible using modules like tkinter and mysql.connector. 
This provides an easy way to perform the long draining task of creating a MySQL table through its native command line. 
This program is capable to get values in a spreadsheet-like interface and create a table in a computer.
The main objective of this program is to let users create a table in MySQL with high efficiency.
MySQL being a query language that is soulfully dependent on a command line interface turns out to be unwieldy and difficult to handle 
even for a basic task like creating a table and adding values into it. In order to insert values into an SQL table we would have to create multiple “ insert into” queries, 
and those values have to be in the order of columns created. But with this program it is an easy task to create up to a 10 x 25 tablet within a matter of minutes, 
the main advantage is that the end-user does not even need to know any queries in order to perform this task with ease.

This project was done entirely by myself for my high school project!
